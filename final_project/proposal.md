## Right to Repair Ethical Dilemma
* e-waste is harmful; can be solved by right to repair
* comparison of recycling systems
* more profitable to replace rather than Repair
* consumer point of view: wasteful for resources and money
* litigation/lobbyists for right to Repair
* compare phone repairs with car repairs

## Solutions
* political lobby for right to repairs
* lens of monopolizing repairs

## A description of how you will provide a program as part of the project 
* a questionnaire to figure out how much e-waste a person produces
* right to repair: data base of how easy a company makes to repair that device
