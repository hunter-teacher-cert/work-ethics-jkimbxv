##Continue to study the provided seating code to make sure you understand it.
##Design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably.
###Write up a description of your algorithm and save it as week_03_seating/seating.pdf. Make sure this description states how it should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.
###NO CODE NEEDED HERE just a description but make a note of implementation issues that might make your algorithm more practical or more difficult to implement
##find another example where optimization of one thing has ethical ramifications and unintended consequences. bonus points if it's an ethical optimization, that is, they optimize for a good ethical reason but it has a negative unintended consequence. Post article link or reference to this to slack
###make a file week_03_planes/consequences.md  with link to article
