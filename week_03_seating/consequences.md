Tiktok's content optimization causes an echo chamber preventing people from encountering different views. https://www.axios.com/inside-tiktoks-killer-algorithm-52454fb2-6bab-405d-a407-31954ac1cf16.html

I'm not sure if this is exactly optimization but anyone who is on TikTok can see how quickly its algorithm can figure out what your interests are. The algorithm is then designed to show you more of the same--to the point where people say there are certain "sides" of TikTok. Are you on the NYC side of TikTok? Are you on the Teacher side of TikTok? The app figures it out quickly.

The issue here is that the app is frequented by young people who are more impressionable. The app creates an echo chamber, making it seem like everyone agrees with you and any opposing view is apprehensible. Seemingly they'd optimize this to bring the user "relatable content" and be able to target ads so not sure it had a 100% ethical start but definitely causing an issue now.

I'm finding when we have in-class discussions of controversial topics, the students get much more heated quickly and unable to see the opposing view.
