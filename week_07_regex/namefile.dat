Bronxville High School will present Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” as its outdoor fall play from Oct. 29-31. Directed by Robert Cross, the tense drama about a society under intense scrutiny and pressure chronicles the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692.

“There, personal vendettas collide with lust, pride and an authoritarian theocracy, fueling widespread hysteria,” Cross said. “As paranoia grips Salem, reason succumbs to fear and all hell breaks loose in this visceral outdoors production of Miller’s riveting masterpiece.”

Cross said Miller’s classic tale explores the themes of lies, reputation, pressure, authority, gender tension, honor and identity.

“With this production, we aim to amplify the tension and pressure each of ‘The Crucible’s’ characters face by staging the show with a thrust stage,” Cross said. “This means the audience will be surrounding the actors on three sides; in some cases, audience members on bleachers will literally be peering down on the action and helping to create a society in Salem under intense scrutiny.”

Similarly, Cross said, the set has been designed to echo the pressure and potential for defeat by mimicking a competitive sporting arena set before a dystopic and unwelcoming forest.

The show features a talented group of 22 students in the cast and 20 students supporting them behind the scenes. The cast is led by Simon De Greiff Rubio (John Proctor), Grace Gramins (Abigail Williams), Elizabeth Burnell (Elizabeth Proctor), Paul Hodulik (Deputy Governor Danforth), Will Bornmann (Reverend Hale), Maggie Krieg (Mary Warren), Thomas Cevasco (Judge Hathorne), Ethan Sanna (Giles Corey) and Manu Monogenis (Francis Nurse).

The performances will take place outside near the auditorium steps on Friday, Oct. 29, at 12:30 p.m. for high school seniors only; Saturday, Oct. 30, at 3 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 31, at 3 p.m. Tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the door.
